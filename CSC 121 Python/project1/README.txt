Project 2:
Chapters 15, 16, and 17
From Eric Matthes, Python Crash Course 2nd Edition

The programs and files contained in this folder were built and tested using pythyon --version 3.11.1. They work with the following dependencies:

matplotlib // install with: python -m pip install --user matplotlib
plotly // install with: python -m pip instll --user plotly
requests // install with: python -m pip install --user requests

all other modules used are included in the standard python library. 

program files contain commented out sections of code that can be uncommented and ran independently.
