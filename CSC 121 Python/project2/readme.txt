This project contains 5 directories, each housing a Python Django project.
You will need to activate a virtual environment for each project to view the 
output locally in the browser. The needed dependencies are listed at the bottom
of this readme. The blog and learning_log projects will require all dependencies
to fully interact and display properly. However, the other projects are much 
smaller in scope and only require Django to be installed. The blog has been 
further customized with Bootstrap styling elements. Enjoy exploring the projects
and apps contained in this directory!
